Section 1.1 Usage of console:
console.log("Type message here") prints the message.

It can also be used to display stored variables.
var hi = "test"
console.log(hi)

We can log two or more variables, we can use comma to seperate them.
var hi = "test1"
var bye = "test2"
console.log(hi,bye)

We can log objects too, which is useful for API calls
console.log({
'Email' : '123@gmail.com',
'Name' : 'Test',
})

We can also log HTML components, such as body or head etc.
console.log(document.body)

Section 1.2 Using the DOM API
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is an object-oriented representation of structured documents like XML
e.g we have a paragraph with id "ok"
<p id="ok"></p>
We dont have any text in it. To manipulate it or add text in it, we can type
document.getElementbyId("ok").textContent = "test"
The first line of code will now be seen as 
<p id="ok">test<p/>

We can also do this same for manipulating the body tags

We can create an alert box by the following command:
alert('test')

Also, we can use promt on screen e.g.
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log(name);
