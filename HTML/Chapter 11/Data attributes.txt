Data attributes were introduced in HTML5 which is supported by all modern browsers, but older browsers before
HTML5 don't recognize the data attributes.
However, in HTML specifications, attributes that are not recognized by the browser must be left alone and the
browser will simply ignore them when rendering the page.
Web developers have utilized this fact to create non-standard attributes which are any attributes not part of the
HTML specifications.
