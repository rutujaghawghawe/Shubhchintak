See the Content Language topic for more information.
<head>
Opens the head section, which does not appear in the main browser window but mainly contains information about the HTML document, called metadata. 
It can also contain imports from external stylesheets and scripts. The closing tag is </head>.
<meta>
Gives the browser some metadata about the document. The charset attribute declares the character encoding. 
Modern HTML documents should always use UTF-8, even though it is not a requirement. 
In HTML, the <meta> tag does not require a closing tag.
<title> The title of the page. Text written between this opening and the closing tag (</title>) will be
displayed on the tab of the page or in the title bar of the browser.
<body> 
Opens the part of the document displayed to users, i.e. all the visible or audible content of a page. 
No content should be added after the closing tag </body>.
<h1> A level 1 heading for the page.
<p> Represents a common paragraph of text.
